# Contributing and reporting issues

To report any issues with using HTML_CodeSniffer, please use the [HTML_CodeSniffer Issue Tracker](http://github.com/squizlabs/HTML_CodeSniffer/issues).

Contributions to the HTML_CodeSniffer code base are also welcome: please create a fork of the main repository, then submit your modified code through a [Pull Request](http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/) for review. A Pull Request also automatically creates an issue in the Issue Tracker, so if you have code to contribute, you do not need to do both.
