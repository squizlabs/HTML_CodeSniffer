<h4 id="alternatives-for-non-text-content">Alternatives for non-text content</h4>

<p>A large proportion of the tests performed for Success Criterion 1.1.1 relate to text
alternatives for images, objects such as Flash movies, and other "non-text content" -
the latter fully defined as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language
  <em>Note:</em> This includes ASCII Art (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, leetspeak (which uses character substitution), and images representing text</p>
  
  <p><cite>Understanding WCAG 2.0:
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2010/NOTE-UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20-20101014/text-equiv-all.html#key-terms">Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1 - definitions section</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In one way or another, non-text content should be provided with a text alternative
that can effectively substitute for the non-text content when not available - for
instance, when using a screen reader which cannot "see" the true content of images, or
where a required plugin may not be installed (or even available) for certain complex
objects. For instance, replacing Flash content with simply "you need to install the Flash
plugin" is insufficient - it means users unable to use Flash have no ability to access
your content.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Note:</em> If the non-text content is simply repeating what is primarily available in an
  accessibility-supported way, then its content is already described, in a roundabout
  way: the body text of the web page being a long text alternative.</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><em>Example:</em> a web page which contains the details of a marketing brochure is supplemented
   with a copy of that brochure in a <acronym title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> document. If the contents of the two are the same,
   then this should be considered sufficient.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This is similar to the "media alternative for text" exemptions found in the time-based
  media criteria of WCAG 2.0, such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/media-equiv-av-only-alt.html">Success Criterion 1.2.1</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="short-and-long-text-alternatives">Short and long text alternatives</h5>

<p>The WCAG specification makes mention of two "lengths" of text alternatives: short and
long. This passage generally describes where a long-text alternative should be used:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If possible, the short text alternative should completely convey the purpose and information.
  If it is not possible to do this in a short phrase or sentence, then the short text alternative
  should provide a brief overview of the information. A long text alternative would be used in
  addition to convey the full information.</p>
  
  <p><cite>Techniques for WCAG 2.0:
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G94">G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>An example would be providing a chart of, say, downloads figures for HTML&#95;CodeSniffer
over the course of a year. The short text alternative would say, for instance, "Graph
of HTML&#95;CodeSniffer downloads by month over the past year". Following this would be, for
instance, a table of the actual download numbers, or a link to a page containing such a table.
Alternatively, the long description would provide a summary of the trends that the graph
was included to show.</p>

<p>The methods of providing short and long text alternatives are summarised in
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/text-equiv-all.html">Understanding Success Criterion 1.1.1</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The longdesc attribute should be avoided for providing a long text alternative.
  Although screen readers are usually able to access it, browsers in general do not
  support it on their own, thereby depriving other classes of users - for instance,
  those with mild visual disabilities and use zooming instead of a screen reader.
  Better alternatives are to include it in the body text after the non-text content,
  or to provide a link to a page with a long description.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="decorative-images">Decorative images</h4>

<p>All images must contain a short text alternative to satisfy Success Criterion 1.1.1, however
it is possible for the text alternative to be empty. If the image does not convey information,
the text alternative makes sense to be blank.</p>

<p>HTML_CodeSniffer will emit a warning for each image that contains an empty alt attribute,
so authors ensure that the images are indeed decorative. The title attribute must also be either
absent or empty, otherwise. An attribute consisting entirely of whitespace is also considered
"empty".</p>

<p>Another alternative to including purely decorative images is through use of CSS (see Technique
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/C9">C9: Using CSS to include decorative images</a>).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Technique C9 reminds authors and designers that including images through CSS is "not
  appropriate for any image that conveys information or provides functionality, or for
  any image primarily intended to create a specific sensory experience". Style sheets
  can always be overridden with a user-specific style sheet, or ignored completely or
  partially in certain situations - eg. in a screen reader scenario, where the "speech"
  media type would ignore image-related CSS rules.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="appropriate-text-alternatives">Appropriate text alternatives</h4>

<p>This section describes appropriate short and long text alternatives for each possible
type of non-text content.</p>

<h5 id="standalone-img-elements">Standalone img elements</h5>

<p>The purpose of a standalone img element should be summarised in a short text alternative,
presuming the image is not purely decorative.</p>

<p>Note that it's the purpose that should be described, not necessarily a description
of the image:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#91;<em>Example:</em>&#93; A picture shows how a knot is tied including arrows showing how the ropes go to make the knot. The text alternative describes how to tie the knot, not what the picture looks like.</p>
  
  <p><cite>Techniques for WCAG 2.0: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G94">G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="linked-img-elements">Linked img elements</h5>

<p>When the img element is linked to another page or fragment, the rules of <a href="./2_4_4">Success Criterion 2.4.4</a>
and <a href="./2_4_9">Success Criterion 2.4.9</a> override the previous section: the contents of the link must describe
the purpose of the link. Where the img element is the only contents of the link, this means its short text
alternative (ie. alt text) must describe the link's purpose:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&#91;<em>Example:</em>&#93; A search button uses an image of a magnifying glass. The text alternative is "search" and not "magnifying glass".</p>
  
  <p><cite>Techniques for WCAG 2.0: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/G94">G94: Providing short text alternative for non-text content that serves the same purpose and presents the same information as the non-text content</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where an img element is combined with text, the combined contents of the two would
describe the link's purpose. It is possible in this context that the image adds no
further information to the text, and thus can be marked "decorative" with an empty
alt text. Certainly, the text and image should not say the same thing - see
"Link stuttering" below.</p>

<h5 id="image-submit-buttons">Image submit buttons</h5>

<p>Image submit buttons follow the same rules as images linked in "a" elements: their
text alternative should describe the purpose of the button, not necessarily describe
the image.</p>

<h5 id="client-side-image-maps">Client-side image maps</h5>

<p>Appropriate accessibility in client-side image maps (using the "map" element) are
covered in technique <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H24">H24: Providing text alternatives for the area elements of image maps</a>.</p>

<p>Each "area" element of a client-side image map should contain alt text as to the
purpose of the link created by the image (as these are links). Alternatively, the web
page can use a redundant mechanism (such as a list of links) to provide descriptions
of the areas in the map.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The latter method may be preferred due to inconsistent user support for alt
  attributes in image maps - particularly in cases of keyboad navigation, or when
  images are disabled.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="object-elements">Object elements</h5>

<p>Embedded objects (using the "object" element), such as Flash movies, Java applets,
and so on, allow both text and non-text alternatives to be provided as fallback
content. For instance, a movie may be replaced with a static image, which may itself
provide alt text (if provided using img) or its own fallback content (if using nested
object tags).</p>

<p>In these cases, it is important that an alternative be provided to the contents of
the object element. This may be using the body of the innermost object element, or
by other methods of providing a long text alternative. HTML&#95;CodeSniffer produces
an error when a non-text alternative cannot be found in an object element group, as this
is most likely to be a mistake. However, other long text alternative methods should
also be sufficient.</p>

<h5 id="applet-elements">Applet elements</h5>

<p>Although non-standard (except for very early versions of HTML), applet elements are
still reasonably well supported throughout most browsers. The W3C standard recommends
that the object element be used instead.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the <em>Techniques for WCAG 2.0</em> document contains one technique regarding
the use of the applet element. This element is slightly more complicated when it comes
to text alternatives than the object element, since it has two separate alternatives:</p>

<ul>
<li>A body text section, for providing an alternative where the rendering interface
of the browser (eg. Gecko, Webkit) does not recognise the applet tag without a
plugin (and the plugin is not there), or</li>
<li>An alt attribute, for browsers whose rendering interface recognises the applet tag
built-in (Internet Explorer in particular) but cannot load the applet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the decision as to which alternative is used is inconsistent between browsers,
these locations should use the same, short text alternative. A long text alternative
can be provided through the usual methods such as body text or a link.</p>

<h4 id="link-combining-and-stuttering-tests">Link combining and stuttering tests</h4>

<p>When an image and adjacent text are to point to the same location, they should be
combined into one link. Sometimes, authors split them into two separate links to avoid having, say, an
underlined character between the two. However:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Visually they appear to be the same link, but they are experienced by many people as two identical links and this can be confusing.</p>
  
  <p><cite>Techniques for WCAG 2.0: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H2">H2: Combining adjacent image and text links for the same resource</a></cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Two incorrect applications of this technique include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keeping the two links, but removing the alt text from the image. This results in a link with no text at all, leading to undefined behaviour.</li>
<li>Combining the links, but keeping the alt text identical with the text content. This results in a link where the link text appears to be stated twice.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> The alt text does not always have to be completely removed. For example, a
link may contain a combination of a file name and a type icon indicating it as a MS
Word Doc file, then the icon can say that it is of a MS Word Doc type. If it says this
in the link text however, then this would not be appropriate.</p>

<h4 id="explicitly-not-tested">Explicitly not tested</h4>

<p>We do not test <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H46">Technique H46: Using noembed with embed</a>. This technique speaks of marrying the non-standard embed element, used by as a forerunner to the HTML 4.0-standard object element, with a noembed element which provides a text alternative. The noembed element could be placed either inside the embed element, or immediately afterwards.</p>

<p>It is arguable that the noembed tag cannot be used in an accessible document, for the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Prior to HTML5, the embed element itself was non-standard. Although this alone does not fail <a href="./4_1_1">Success Criterion 4.1.1 (Parsing)</a> - validation is not a requirement, only well-formedness is - it makes it extremely difficult to satisfy the sufficient techniques. This Success Criterion suggests <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/H74">ensuring opening and closing tags are used according to specification</a> as a technique for HTML serialisation (as well-formedness is not a proper concept in HTML), but embed is not in the HTML spec, does this mean it is impossible to use the tag in HTML 4.0 and pass this Success Criterion?</li>
<li>In HTML5, the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-embed-element.html">embed element is included</a>, however the noembed element is absent. The spec states that the embed element <strong>does not include fallback content</strong>; user agents should use a default plugin instead (even if to say "this content is unsupported"). Therefore, there is no guarantee that the default content will be accessible.</li>
</ol>

<p>Accessible documents should use the object element instead.</p>
