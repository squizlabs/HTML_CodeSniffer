<h4 id="marking-languages-with-attributes">Marking languages with attributes</h4>

<p>The effective language attribute - on the html element or otherwise - is different depending on whether a Web page is rendered as HTML or as XHTML:</p>

<ul>
<li>in HTML, the attribute is called "lang";</li>
<li>in XHTML, the attribute is "xml:lang", as per the XML specification (and this is mandatory for an XHTML document).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where HTML5 is understood by a browser, HTML5 documents will probably use the former attribute,
  because currently they will most likely have been delivered as the content type "text/html"
  (XHTML5 can technically only be delivered using the XHTML content type).</p>
  
  <p>The W3C currently publish a Working Draft on so-called <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html-polyglot/" title="Polyglot Markup: HTML-Compatible XHTML Documents&quot; (">"Polyglot Markup"</a>, which allow compliant documents to be served
  with either content type; it suggests using both attributes and making sure they are identical. This takes advantage of the fact that one
  attribute will be used, and the other will be considered valid but ignored.</p>
  
  <p>Such a concept also exists in XHTML 1.0 in its <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/guidelines.html" title="XHTML 1.0 (Second Edition) - Appendix C: HTML Compatibility Guidelines">HTML Compatibility Guidelines appendix</a>, but not in HTML 4.01.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ability to test for the correct attribute, based on document type, is hampered by two factors:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Internet Explorer, there is no ability to specifically access the doctype through javascript - through document.doctype - except in IE9 Standards Mode;

<ul>
<li>in IE8, this only occurs for XML documents; in HTML the doctype is parsed into the DOM as a comment node.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The mess that is serving XHTML 1.0 as the content type text/html (instead of the intended content type, "application/xhtml+xml"), and what it would actually be parsed as by a browser DOM.</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, HTML_CodeSniffer's automated testing can currently be limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>That at least one of "lang" or "xml:lang" is used. (That the correct one(s) exist is up to the tester as a manual check.)</li>
<li>If both are specified, that they don't conflict with each other (they must be the same when compared case-insensitively).</li>
<li>That they conform to the correct format for language tags (eg. "en"; "en-AU"), as per the <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt">IETF's Best Common Practices #47 document</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="formats-of-language-tags">Formats of language tags</h4>

<p>The IETF's BCP 47 document defines the format of a valid language tag. It is made up of two RFCs: <a href="www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.txt">RFC 5646 "Tags for Identifying Languages"</a>
and <a href="www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4647.txt">RFC 4647 "Matching of Language Tags"</a>; it is the former that defines the format for a valid language tag.</p>

<p>A language tag contains the following subtags, specified in the order provided in the following table. All subtags are joined together with hyphens ('-').</p>

<table>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="row">language</th>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>2-8 letters</td>
<td>Uses the ISO 639 language codes: "Alpha-2" codes take precedence over "Alpha-3" (eg. "en" instead of "eng" for English). Subtags in range qaa-qtz are reserved for private use.<br/>
Four letters are reserved for "possible future standardisation". Alpha-4 codes are used in ISO 639-6 (which was published after publication of RFC 5646), but these are for language variants.<br/>
Five to eight letters are used for registered languages without an ISO 639 code: none are defined and it is unlikely any will; new languages must be submitted for ISO 639 inclusion first.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">extlang</th>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Three letters</td>
<td>Although the definition technically allows up to three extlang subtags, all subtags after the first
were "permanently reserved" when RFC 5646 took effect: "tags that include those subtags in \[the second and third\] position
are, and will always remain, invalid". Most extlang tags have been deprecated by full 3-character language tags.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">script</th>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Four letters, typically written title case</td>
<td>Used to differentiate between languages written in different scripts. For instance, "Latn" for Latin script
(such as that used in English), or "Hant" for Chinese "Traditional Han" script.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">region</th>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>Either two letters (written uppercase), or three digits</td>
<td>Two letters represents the "Alpha-2" code for a country as per ISO 3166-1: eg. "AU" represents Australia, "GB" for the United Kingdom (Great Britain). Codes AA, QM-QZ, XA-XZ, ZZ reserved for private use.
The three-digit form represents a geographical region, as <a href="http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49.htm">defined by the United
Nations Statistical Division</a>: "035" is South-East Asia, "053" is Australia and New Zealand combined, etc.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">variant</th>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Either 5-8 characters, or digit + 3 characters</td>
<td>Represents "additional, well-recognized variations" or dialects that can't be represented by other subtags. For instance, different
romanisations of Mandarin Chinese have variants of "zh-Latn".
The four-character form appears mainly to allow years to be used as variants: eg. "de-1996" represents German
as written following the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography_reform_of_1996">1996 orthography reform</a>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th scope="row">extension</th>
<td>No</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>One character "code", followed by one or more values of 2-8 characters<br/>(all separated by hyphens)</td>
<td>The "code" character cannot be "x", as this defines a privateuse section.</td>

<tr>
<th scope="row">privateuse</th>
<td>Optional</td>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>The letter "x", followed by one or more values of 1-8 characters<br/>(all separated by hyphens)</td>

<blockquote>
  <p>Notes to use of the table:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Allowed characters:</strong> Where "letters" (alphabetic characters) and "digits" are used, only those may be used. Otherwise, any alphanumeric character is usable.</li>
  <li><strong>Case sensitivity:</strong> language tags are case-insensitive; the canonical and recommended method of writing is lowercase except in places in the table which mention capitalisation.</li>
  <li><strong>Extensions:</strong> As of 28 February 2012, two extensions are defined, both managed by the Unicode Consortium:
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>"u"</strong> for specifying various locale attributes of Unicode text, such as collating order (defined in <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6067.txt">RFC 6067</a>)</li>
  <li><strong>"t"</strong> for specifying the source language or script of transformed content, such as transliterations (defined in <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6497.txt">RFC 6497</a>).</li>
  </ul></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Note:</em> Some assistive technologies do not recognise regional differences beyond the primary <strong>language</strong> subtag, or only handle a limited subset of them. For instance, a screen reader could theoretically come with several accents for English - for instance, United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and so on - but only a generic one for Spanish. In the first case, country may be recognised (eg. "en-US" vs. "en-GB"); in the latter, everything after the initial "es" language tag may be ignored.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry">language subtag registry</a> is administered by IANA, and is populated primarily through various ISO standard sources, such as ISO 639 (language codes) and ISO 3166 (country codes). HTML&#95;CodeSniffer does not check for validity against this list, but does check for well-formedness.</p>

<h4 id="using-server-side-techniques">Using server-side techniques</h4>

<p>One advisory technique for Success Criterion 3.1.1 is <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-TECHS/SVR5">SVR5: Specifying the default language in the HTTP header</a>.
This suggests to use the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.12">Content-Language HTTP header</a> to identify the intended
audiences for a web page.</p>

<p>The Content-Language header's primary use is as part of the content negotiation process. User agents can send a list of languages in which
they would prefer to receive documents (using the Accept-Language request header), and a server can potentially contain multiple versions
of documents for various languages. This negotiation can take place at a script level, or at the server itself: for instance, the help
documentation installed by default on an Apache server is served using in-built content language negotiation.</p>

<p><acronym title="Request for Comments">RFC</acronym> 2616 (which defines <abbr title="Hypertext Transfer Protocol, version 1.1">HTTP/1.1</abbr>)
gives an example of where multiple entries in the Content-Language header may be appropriate, and when it may not:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Multiple languages MAY be listed for content that is intended for multiple audiences. For example, a rendition of the "Treaty of
  Waitangi," presented simultaneously in the original Maori and English versions, would call for</p>

<pre><code>Content-Language: mi, en
</code></pre>
  
  <p>However, just because multiple languages are present within an entity does not mean that it is intended for multiple linguistic audiences.
  An example would be a beginner's language primer, such as "A First Lesson in Latin," which is clearly intended to be used by an
  English-literate audience. In this case, the Content-Language would properly only include "en".</p>
  
  <p><cite><a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt">IETF RFC 2616: Hypertext Transfer Protocol &mdash; HTTP/1.1</a>, section 14.12: "Content-Language"</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the Content-Language header cannot be relied upon on its own - its primary purpose being content negotiation, it increases the
possibility that a user is served content in a language that best suits them. However, this does not remove the requirement to mark languages
within the document itself, as Content-Language does not affect the language in which the document is ultimately processed.</p>
