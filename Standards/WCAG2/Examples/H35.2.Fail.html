        <h1>H35.2 Missing Applet Alt Attribute Failure</h1>

        <applet code="lake.class" width="250" height="500">
            <p>Lake applet long description</p>
        </applet>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>According to Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content), all non-text content should contain at least a short text
        alternative, such as through alt text. However, if the short text alternative is not enough to fully describe the
        non-text content, a long description should be provided. An example may be the contents of a graph: the alt text may
        say &quot;Graph of sales by quarter&quot; but it does not describe the points of the graph.</p>

        <p>This should fail because the alt attribute has not been provided. Both alt attributes and body text are required.
        The alt attribute will be used by browsers that understand the applet tag natively (such as some versions of Internet
        Explorer) but cannot load the applet. The body text will be used by browsers without native support for Java, where
        it would ignore the applet tags.</p>
