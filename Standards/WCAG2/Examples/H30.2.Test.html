        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>According to Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content), all non-text content, including images,
        should have a short text alternative, and (if required) a long text alternative.</p>

        <p>When an image is used as the only content within a link, the alt text of the image should indicate
        the function of the link - this is slightly different to the normal requirement that it describe the
        image (although in a perfect environment, it should describe both).</p>

        <p>This is a regression test for GitHub issue #52. There are three links in the tested paragraph.
        The first one is an image with empty alt text which should generate the H30.2 error, used as a control.
        The third includes the additional text in a STRONG tag, which previously passed.</p>

        <p>The second includes additional text, not included in a tag, and it is this that we are testing
        as a regression to issue #52.</p>

        <h2>Expected Results</h2>

        <p>The <strong>first link</strong> should emit the following Error:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><em>[Standard]</em>.Principle1.Guideline1_1.1_1_1.H30.2: &quot;Img element is the only content of the link, but is missing alt text. The alt text should describe the purpose of the link.&quot;</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The <strong>second and third links</strong> should not throw this error (but should throw a warning: H67.2,
        stating the image is ignored by assistive technology). A H30.2 error in the second link indicates a regression
        for issue #52, and an error in the third is a regression from what was previously working.</p>
