        <h1>G94/G92 Applet Tag Notice</h1>

        <applet code="lake.class" width="250" height="500" alt="Lake applet">
            <p>Lake applet long description</p>
        </applet>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>According to Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content), all non-text content should contain at least a short text
        alternative, such as through alt text. However, if the short text alternative is not enough to fully describe the
        non-text content, a long description should be provided. An example may be the contents of a graph: the alt text may
        say &quot;Graph of sales by quarter&quot; but it does not describe the points of the graph.</p>

        <p>This demonstrates correct usage of short and long alternatives using the applet element. The applet element
        is non-standard in HTML 4.01 (and obsolete in HTML5), but is widely understood across all browsers - if not natively,
        as it is usually provided by the relevant Java plugin.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that both alt attributes and body text are required. The alt attribute will be used by browsers
        that understand the applet tag natively (such as some versions of Internet Explorer) but cannot load the applet.
        The body text will be used by browsers without native support for Java, where it would ignore the applet tags -
        in this case, it behaves much like an object tag.</p>
