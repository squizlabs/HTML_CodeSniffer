        <h1>H49 Presentational Markup Warning</h1>

        <p>
            Don't use <b>bold text</b>, <i>italics</i> and <u>underlines</u> with impunity.<br/>
            <s>Strike one</s>, <strike>strike two.</strike> <font size="5">Get out</font>. <tt>T_T</tt><br/>
            You shouldn't feel too <big>big</big> not to use semantic content, nor too <small>small</small> to hide from it.<br/>
        </p>
        <center>Centre your eyes towards this presentational code.</center>
        <p align="right">Then move them to the right, when you should be using CSS instead.</p>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>According to Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships), authors should use semantic markup wherever possible.</p>

        <p>In HTML 4.01, the above presentational elements and attributes are considered to have no semantic meaning, and thus should be
        replaced with semantic elements where possible. However, also consider whether you are using the <em>correct</em> semantic element -
        if you are using bold text for normal emphasis, it may be more correct to use the "em" element and redefine it to bold text using CSS.</p>

        <p>In HTML5, some presentational elements such as "b", "i" and "u" have been redefined to have <em>limited</em> semantic meaning,
        making them usable but only as a last resort.</p>

        <p>Remember that presentational elements do not need to be completely eliminated, but they should be seriously considered, making sure
        to check whether a semantic element should be used instead. For instance, if the contents of elements such as "b" meet the HTML5 definition
        and do not require emphasis (as suggested by "strong" or "em"), the case can be made for keeping the "b" element. If there appears to be
        no semantic meaning at all, it may be more prudent to replace with a span element and style using CSS.</p>

        <h2>Expected Warnings</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><em>[Standard]</em>.Principle1.Guideline1_3.1_3_1.H49.*: "Semantic markup should be used to mark emphasised or special text so that it can be programmatically determined."</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>(The "*" represents the name of the presentational tag being questioned, with first character capitalised, eg. "I", "Big", "Tt", etc.
        Uses of the "align" attribute are end with "AlignAttr".)</i></p>
