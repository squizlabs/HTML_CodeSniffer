        <h1>H83.3 New Window Advice Warning</h1>

        <a href="htmlcs.html" target="_blank">Click me</a>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>Success Criterion 3.2.5 (Change on Request) says that the content must have a mode available which requires no
        automatic <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#context-changedef">change of context</a>
        for the functionality to be completed. All changes of context should be initiated by the user, or a mechanism
        is available to turn off any automated changes.</p>

        <p>One possible issue with links is that they may open in a new window without warning, thus failing this Success
        Criterion. If a user is told the link opens in a new window, it is OK.</p>

        <p>If HTML_CodeSniffer sees a link with a target of "_blank", it will check for the mention of "new window" in the
        link text. If it cannot, it will emit a warning.</p>

        <p>Note that the "new window" mention has to be in the link text, since this is a <abbr title="Triple A">AAA</abbr> test,
        and thus Success Crterion 2.4.9 (Link Purpose: Link Only) also applies.</p>

        <p><em>Note:</em> This test must be performed at <abbr title="Triple-A">AAA</abbr> level. By default, the bookmarklet will
        not show this message, as it defaults to <abbr title="Double-A">AA</abbr> level.</p>

        <h2>Expected Warnings</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><em>[Standard]</em>.Principle3.Guideline3_2.3_2_5.H83.3: "Check that this link's link text contains information indicating that the link will open in a new window."</li>
        </ul>
