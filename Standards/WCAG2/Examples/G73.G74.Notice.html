        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>According to Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-Text Content), all non-text content should contain at least a short text alternative,
        such as through alt text. However, if the short text alternative is not enough to fully describe the non-text content, a long
        description should be provided. An example may be the contents of a graph: the alt text may say "Graph of sales by quarter" but
        it does not describe the points of the graph.</p>

        <p>HTML_CodeSniffer will emit notices for images to ensure that a long alternative is available. The longdesc attribute should
        <em>not</em> be used, as this is outdated and obsolete in HTML5. Instead, a long alternative should be provided in the body
        text immediately surrounding the element, or through a link to another page.</p>

        <h2>Expected Notices</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><em>[Standard]</em>.Principle1.Guideline1_1.1_1_1.G73,G74: &quot;If this image cannot be fully described in a short text alternative, ensure a long text alternative is also available, such as in the body text or through a link.&quot;</li>
        </ul>
