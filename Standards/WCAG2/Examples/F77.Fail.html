        <h1>F77 Duplicate ID Failure</h1>

        <form>
            <input type="text" id="control1" value="field 1" title="Field 1" />
            <input type="text" id="control1" value="field 2" title="Field 2" />
            <input type="Submit" value="Submit Form" />
        </form>

        <p>A one-to-one relationship should be able to be determined between IDs and elements with IDs. Therefore,
        controls with duplicate IDs are a failure of the specs of Success Criterion 4.1.1 (Parsing).
        In XML serialisation, such a document would not be well-formed unless duplicate IDs are explicitly allowed.</p>

        <p>HTML_CodeSniffer currently documents this as failure F77. It could be argued that it also fails F17,
        about not being able to determine a one-to-one relationship between elements - if there were a label or script
        that referenced the input fields, a one-to-one mapping would not be possible.</p>
