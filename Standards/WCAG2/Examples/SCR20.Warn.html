        <h1>SCR20 Keyboard Events Warning</h1>

        <form>
            <label for="input">Text Input:</label>
            <input type="text" id="input" value="" onmousedown="return foo();" onmouseup="return bar();" onmousemove="return baz();" />
            <div ondblclick="alert('Double Click');">Double Click Me!</div>
            <div onmouseover="alert('Moused In');" onmouseout="alert('Moused Out');">Move into and out of me!</div>
        </form>

        <p>Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard) states that all functionality provided by the content should be operable using the
        keyboard, "except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not
        just the endpoints". The <abbr title="Triple A">AAA</abbr> version of this is Success Criterion 2.1.3 (Keyboard: No Exception),
        which precludes content requiring the quoted exception from reaching <abbr title="Triple A">AAA</abbr> conformance.</p>

        <p>This example should fire warnings relating to the usage of mouse-specific events for performing functionality.
        Authors should check that the functionality provided by these events are also provided by keyboard events in some fashion,
        or consider using device-neutral events. The messages provide suggested alternative events, but these do not have to be
        followed exactly as long as the functionality is available.</p>

        <p>These warnings will appear even if there are the equivalent suggested keyboard events available, because the author
        should check that the included keyboard events provide all of the functionality of the mouse events.</p>

        <h2>Expected Warnings</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><em>[Standard]</em>.Principle2.Guideline2_1.2_1_1.SCR20.*: "Ensure the functionality provided by &lt;event name&gt; on this element is available through the keyboard; for instance, using &lt;alternative event&gt;."</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>(The "*" in the message is replaced by the name of the mouse event: MouseDown, MouseUp, MouseMove, MouseOver, MouseOut, or DblClick.)</i></p>
