            <p>Input field: <input id="inputField" value="" /></p>
        </form>

        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>This is a <strong>regression test</strong> for <a href="https://github.com/squizlabs/HTML_CodeSniffer/issues/57">Issue 57</a>. Script errors were being
        reported in some browsers when input elements did not have type attributes.</p>

        <p>Before the issue was fixed, the above field would throw a script error along the lines of "Unable to call toLowerCase() of null" in the
        testLabelsOnInputs method in the SC 1.3.1 test. It should check to see whether the type attribute exists, and if not present, default to "text".</p>
