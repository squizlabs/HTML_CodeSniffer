        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>According to Success Criterion 1.1.1 (Non-text Content), all non-text content should contain at least a short text
        alternative, such as through alt text. However, if the short text alternative is not enough to fully describe the
        non-text content, a long description should be provided. An example may be the contents of a graph: the alt text may
        say &quot;Graph of sales by quarter&quot; but it does not describe the points of the graph.</p>

        <p>When images are used standalone, the descriptions provided by the alt text should match the purpose of the image,
        <em>and convey the same information</em> where this is possible. This may be important for something like an image gallery,
        where the alt text should describe the image, not just duplicate the title of the image. For an image used as a
        decorative header, it could be argued that it should have null alt text instead.</p>
