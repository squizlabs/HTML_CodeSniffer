        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <p>According to Success Criterion 1.3.1 (Info and Relationships), providing a caption and/or summary can improve the usability
        of a table in different ways. A caption element titles the table and is seen by all users. A summary attribute (on the table
        element) provides additional information for users requiring assistance, who may be reading the table cell-by-cell and therefore
        cannot immediately grasp the concept of the table's organisation as a whole.</p>

        <p>This example demonstrates correct usage of a summary element (and also a caption). A notice should be emitted to remind authors
        that the summary should serve its purpose. In this case, the ordering of the table may not be apparent - if you simply hear
        "Stop Name" in the top-left cell, for instance, do the stops go down the page or across it? The summary therefore provides
        context and instructions on how to use the table.</p>

        <p>If the summary is omitted in a case like this, it may still pass the Success Criterion if such instructions were embedded
        ahead of the table in the body text, so all users can see it. If the table is difficult to understand by sighted users,
        instructions may be better placed in body text so no-one is disadvantaged.</p>
